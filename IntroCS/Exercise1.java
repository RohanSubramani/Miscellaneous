// ******************************************
// Exercise1
// 
// In this exercise you will simply print your favorite greeting to the
// monitor (No obscenities please!). What you are really doing is just
// getting comfortable with the tools we'll be using this semester.
// 
// In addition to this program, create a plain text file. In it, 
// spend a paragraph telling me and the rest of teaching staff
// a little about yourself. Name your text file readMe.txt
// 
// When you have finished, export your project from Codio. Then
// put this file, Excercise1.java, and your readMe.txt file
// into a single folder called [your_UNI]_ex1 and compress that 
// folder into a zip file. Finally, submit that zip file on Gradescope.
