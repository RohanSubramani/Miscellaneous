      "explanation": "Galois theory is a branch of abstract algebra that studies the relationship between field extensions and group theory, especially focusing on the solvability of polynomial equations by radicals. The core insight is the correspondence between subfields of a given field extension and subgroups of its Galois group. A strong understanding of Galois theory equips one to answer questions about the roots of polynomials, constructible numbers, the impossibility of certain angle trisections, and which equations can be solved by radicals.\n\n**Central Example:**\nSuppose K = Q(\u221a2, \u221a3), the field obtained by adjoining both \u221a2 and \u221a3 to the rationals Q. What is the Galois group of K over Q, and how do its subgroups correspond to intermediate fields?\n\n**Solution:**\nFirst, note that K is a splitting field of (x^2-2)(x^2-3) over Q and thus is a Galois extension of Q. The automorphisms of K are determined completely by their action on \u221a2 and \u221a3, and each can send \u221a2 to \u00b1\u221a2 and \u221a3 to \u00b1\u221a3 independently, since both minimal polynomials remain satisfied, and K contains all these combinations. Thus, the Galois group is isomorphic to C2 \u00d7 C2 (the Klein 4-group), having four automorphisms.\n\nThe correspondence:\n- The subgroups of the Galois group (there are five, including the trivial group and the whole group)\n- The intermediate fields between Q and K\n\nFor more advanced examples, such as why x^5-4x+2=0 cannot be solved by radicals, the structure and order of the Galois group become essential.\n\nDependencies include fields, field extensions, polynomial rings, splitting fields, automorphisms, Galois extensions, and group theory concepts such as normal subgroups and group actions.\n\n**Suggested Review Graph** (will be built as dependencies):\n- Fields and Field Extensions\n- Polynomial Rings and Irreducibility\n- Splitting Fields and Algebraic Closures\n- Automorphisms of Fields\n- Normal and Separable Extensions\n- Galois Extensions and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory\n- Solvability by Radicals and Simple Groups\n- Classic Applications (Constructible Numbers, Insolvability of the Quintic, etc.)\n- Connections to Group Theory: Symmetric Groups, Normal Subgroups, Group Actions, Orbit-Stabilizer, etc.",
