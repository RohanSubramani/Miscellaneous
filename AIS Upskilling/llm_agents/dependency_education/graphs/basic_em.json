      "explanation": "The Biot-Savart Law expresses the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ generated at a point in space by a small segment of current-carrying wire. It is a fundamental law in electromagnetism, describing how moving charges produce magnetic fields.\n\n**Statement:**\n\nGiven a steady current $I$ flowing through a thin wire, the infinitesimal magnetic field $d\\vec{B}$ at a point $P$ due to an infinitesimal segment of wire $d\\vec{l}$ located a displacement vector $\\vec{r}$ away from $P$ is given by:\n\\[\nd\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I\\; d\\vec{l} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\\]\nwhere:\n- $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space ($4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\, \\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{A}^{-2}$),\n- $d\\vec{l}$ is the infinitesimal segment of the wire (a vector in the direction of current),\n- $\\vec{r}$ is the vector from $d\\vec{l}$ to the field point $P$,\n- $r = |\\vec{r}|$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = \\vec{r}/r$ is a unit vector pointing from $d\\vec{l}$ to $P$.\n\nThe total magnetic field is found by integrating over the entire current distribution:\n\\[\n\\vec{B}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{I\\, d\\vec{l}' \\times (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|^3}\n\\]\nwhere $\\vec{r}'$ is a position along the current path, and $\\vec{r}$ is the field point.\n\n---\n\n**Example Problem:**\n\n*Find the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop of radius $R$ carrying current $I$.*\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Consider a circular loop of radius $R$ lying in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin. We seek $\\vec{B}$ at the center ($z=0$).\n2. By symmetry, $d\\vec{l}$ at every point on the loop is tangent to the circle, and $\\vec{r}$ from the segment to the center is of length $R$ and perpendicular to $d\\vec{l}$.\n3. The angle between $d\\vec{l}$ and $\\vec{r}$ is always $90^\\circ$, so $|d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r}| = |d\\vec{l}| R$.\n4. Direction: by the right-hand rule, $\\vec{B}$ points along the axis of the loop (the $z$-axis for counterclockwise current viewed from above).\n5. The magnitude of the infinitesimal contribution:\n   \\[\n   dB = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I |d\\vec{l}| \\sin(90^\\circ)}{R^2} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I |d\\vec{l}|}{R^2}\n   \\]\n6. Integrate $|d\\vec{l}|$ around the whole loop: $\\oint |d\\vec{l}| = 2\\pi R$.\n7. Total field magnitude:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I}{R^2} (2\\pi R) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}\n   \\]\n8. The field points along the axis perpendicular to the loop:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R} \\hat{z}\n   \\]\n\n**Physical Significance:**\n- The Biot-Savart law is analogous to Coulomb\u2019s law, but for magnetic fields produced by currents.\n- It is valid for steady (DC) currents and forms the basis for the derivation of Amp\u00e8re\u2019s law.\n\n**Central Example Summary:**\n- The Biot-Savart law gives the field at the center of a current-carrying loop as $\\vec{B} = (\\mu_0 I)/(2R) \\hat{z}$, a classic result.\n",
