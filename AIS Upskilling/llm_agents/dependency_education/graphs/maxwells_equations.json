      "explanation": "Maxwell's equations are the set of four fundamental equations that form the foundation of classical electromagnetism. They describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of each other. The equations can be written both in integral and differential forms. Their unified description leads to the prediction of electromagnetic waves (light).\n\nTHE EQUATIONS (in SI units):\n1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: \\( \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\)\n   - The electric flux out of any closed surface is proportional to the net charge enclosed within that surface.\n2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: \\( \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0 \\)\n   - There are no magnetic monopoles; the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero.\n3. Faraday's Law of Induction: \\( \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} \\)\n   - A time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field (basis of electromagnetic induction).\n4. Amp\u00e8re's Law with Maxwell's Addition: \\( \\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{J} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t} \\)\n   - Magnetic fields are generated by electric currents and time-varying electric fields.\n\nAPPLICATIONS & EXAMPLES:\n\nExample Problem:\nA long straight wire carries a steady current I. Calculate the magnetic field at distance r from the wire using Amp\u00e8re's Law.\n\nSolution:\n1. Choose an Amperian loop: a circle of radius r centered on the wire.\n2. \\( \\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{J} \\) (steady current, so last term is zero)\n3. Integral form: \\( \\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc} \\)\n4. The field is tangent to the loop and constant in magnitude (symmetry).\n5. Left side: \\( B \\times 2\\pi r \\)\n6. Right side: \\( \\mu_0 I \\)\n7. Solve: \\( B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r} \\)\n\nThis result matches the Biot-Savart Law.\n\nMaxwell's equations are the backbone for all of classical electromagnetism, optics, and electrical engineering. Their solutions describe radio waves, light, X-rays, etc., as manifestations of electromagnetic waves.",

It is used to calculate electric fields, especially in situations with symmetry (spherical, cylindrical, planar), greatly simplifying computation versus directly using Coulomb's Law.\n\nExample Problem:\nFind the electric field at a distance r outside a uniformly charged sphere of total charge Q and radius a (r > a).\n\nSolution:\n- Symmetry: Use a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r > a centered at the sphere's center. The electric field E is radial and constant on this surface.\n- Gauss's Law: \u222e E \u00b7 dA = Q_enclosed/\u03b50. For our Gaussian surface, the total flux is E(4\u03c0r^2), and Q_enclosed = Q.\n- So, E(4\u03c0r^2) = Q/\u03b50 \u21d2 E = (1/4\u03c0\u03b50) (Q/r^2).\nThis reproduces the result from Coulomb's Law for a point charge located at the center.",
