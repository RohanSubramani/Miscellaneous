      "explanation": "The classical phase space is a 6N-dimensional space of all positions and momenta for an N-particle system. The number of microstates with energy \\( \\leq E \\) is found by integrating over all allowed (p, q):\\n\\n\\[\\n\\int_{H(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}) \\leq E} d^{3N}q\\, d^{3N}p\\n\\]\\nFor a gas in a cubic box, the position integral gives \\( V^N \\) (V = volume), and the momentum integral is over a 3N-sphere with radius \\( \\sqrt{2mE} \\):\\n\\n\\[\\n\\int_{\\sum_i p_i^2 \\leq 2mE} d^{3N}p = \\frac{(2\\pi m E)^{3N/2}}{\\Gamma(3N/2+1)}\\n\\]\\n\\nDividing by h^{3N} (quantum) and N! (indistinguishability), we get the statistical mechanics result for classical gases.\\n\nExample: For N = 1 (a single particle), this gives the familiar 6-dimensional phase space ball for the allowed momenta and a position integral over V.",
