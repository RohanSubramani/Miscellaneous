It tells us when it is possible to control for a set of variables (conditioning) to block all spurious backdoor paths from X to Y, thereby allowing the identification of the true causal effect from X to Y.\\n\\nDefinition (Pearl, 1995):\\nA set of variables Z satisfies the *backdoor criterion* relative to an ordered pair of variables (X, Y) in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) if:\\n1. No node in Z is a descendant of X.\\n2. Z blocks every path between X and Y that contains an arrow into X (i.e., every backdoor path from X to Y).\\n\\n**Interpretation:**\\n- \\\"Backdoor paths\\\" are paths from X to Y that start with an arrow pointing into X. These represent potential sources of confounding—variables that affect both X and Y.\\n- By blocking such paths (through conditioning on specific variables), we can estimate the causal effect of X on Y as if we had performed an intervention, under the assumption that the graph accurately represents the data generating process.\\n\\n**Example:**\\nSuppose we have the following DAG:\\n\\nU → X → Y\\nU → Y\\n\\nHere, U is an unobserved confounder that affects both X and Y. The path U → X → Y represents the causal effect of X on Y, but the path U → Y is a backdoor path that creates confounding.\\n\\n- The only backdoor path from X to Y is X ← U → Y (i.e., via U).\\n- If U is observed, conditioning on U blocks this backdoor path, so Z = {U} satisfies the backdoor criterion.\\n- If U is unobserved, then the backdoor criterion fails, and we cannot estimate the causal effect using observational data alone.\\n\\n**General Steps to Check Backdoor Criterion:**\\n1. Draw the DAG of the problem.\\n2. List all backdoor paths from X to Y.\\n3. Identify a set Z such that:\\n   - Z contains no descendants of X.\\n   - Z blocks all backdoor paths (using the rules of d-separation).\\n\\n**Formal Statement:**\\nIf Z satisfies the backdoor criterion for (X, Y), then the interventional distribution $$P(Y \\\\mid do(X))$$ can be computed from observational data as:\\n$$P(Y \\\\mid do(X)) = \\\\sum_z P(Y \\\\mid X, Z=z) P(Z=z)$$\\n\\nThus, the backdoor criterion is central to using observational data for causal effect estimation in structural causal models.\",\"dependencies\":[\"Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\",\"Causal Inference\",\"Do-Calculus\",\"d-Separation\",\"Confounding and Confounders\",\"Conditional Probability and Conditioning\",\"Structural Causal Models (SCMs)\",\"Paths in Graphs\",\"Blocking in Graphs\",\"Interventional vs Observational Distributions\"]}"
