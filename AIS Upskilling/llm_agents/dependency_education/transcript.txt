As a heuristic, you should aim for at least 10 properly explained nodes and at least 3 layers of dependencies. The example problems and solutions you provide within the explanation should be detailed, with no skipped steps except those justified in detail by a dependency. You should finish these 10 or more explanations on your own, without asking the user for help or confirmation."

In this experiment, neutral silver atoms were passed through a non-uniform magnetic field. According to classical physics, if the intrinsic magnetic moment were oriented randomly, one would expect a continuous distribution of atom positions at the detector. Instead, the experiment showed that the atoms are deflected in a pattern that suggests the atomic magnetic moment is quantized - two discrete lines for electrons which are spin-1/2 particles. This result provided evidence for quantum mechanics - the concept that certain physical quantities only take discrete values. The setup of the experiment and its results are crucial for understanding further concepts in quantum mechanics such as quantum entanglement and the measurement problem in physics.\",\"dependencies\":[\"Quantum Mechanics\",\"Angular Momentum\",\"Magnetic Moment\",\"Spin\",\"Entanglement\",\"Measurement Problem\"]}"
