There are not two distinct elements, but vacuously no counterexample with size >½ can avoid having a dividing pair once size≥2.  To kick off cleanly one can check n=2 instead: any 2‐element subset of {1,2} is {1,2}, and 1∣2.  \n\nInductive step.  \nAssume the statement holds for every positive integer up to n−1.  We prove it for n.\n\nLet S⊆{1,2,…,n} with |S|>n/2.  Two cases:\n\n1. n∉S.  \n   Then S⊆{1,…,n−1}, and |S|>n/2≥(n−1)/2.  By the inductive hypothesis on n−1, S already contains a dividing pair.\n\n2. n∈S.  \n   If there is some x∈S\\{n} with x∣n, we are done.  Otherwise no other element of S divides n.  Remove n and set S′=S\\{n}.  Then  \n     \n     |S′| = |S|−1  > n/2 −1  = (n−2)/2.  \n     \n   But (n−2)/2 = ((n−1)/2)−½, so |S′| > (n−1)/2.  Hence S′⊆{1,…,n−1} has size > (n−1)/2, and by the inductive hypothesis it contains two elements in a dividing relation.  \n\nIn either case S (or S′) has a∣b.  This completes the induction.\n\nTherefore for n=100 any 51‐element subset of {1,2,…,100} must contain two numbers one of which divides the other."
