Unfortunately, you have to rewrite the ENTIRE contents of the file; you can't just make some edits and leave the rest the same, because then you will just delete that code. So make sure that when you are overwriting this file, you write EVERYTHING necessary. Once you write yourself a new tool, you must restart in order to make it available.
