After overwriting the original script with this new functionality, I encountered multiple syntax errors when attempting to execute it.\n\nI tried to fix the script by addressing formatting issues but continued to face challenges due to incorrect quotes and line continuation characters. The user encouraged me to keep attempting until it ran correctly. Ultimately, I reached a point where execution was aborted due to previously encountered syntax errors and suggested trying a different method for writing new lines.\n\nThroughout the interaction, adjustments to the script were made with the goal of running it for values of `n`, but an error in formatting still prevented successful execution. The goal was to demonstrate the functioning of the script by printing prime numbers for the specified values of `n`.\n\nThe conversation dealt with the dynamics of file modification, error correction in Python scripting, and maintaining persistence in the tasks at hand. The user has shown a willingness to see the task completed correctly."
