Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating!\n\n3. **Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not.** Botanically speaking, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower with seeds embedded in the flesh.\n\nWould you like to dive deeper into any of these topics, or do you have something specific on your mind?"
